Prediction Regression Problem.

Aim of Project: Predicting The Credit Card total Revolve Balance.

Dataset Details:

		1. It consist of 21 Numerical counts & 13 Categorical Counts,
		2. I have done EDA to analyze the depth of data and tried to remove unwanted columns which was really not needed for my prediction. 
		3. I have done Normalization to reduce data redundancy for my predictions. 
		4. For some categorical variables i have done One hot encoding technique which was helpful for my predictions.
		
Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Data Analyzed: Regression Problem

Business Benefits: By predicting the credit card revolve balance, company can derive marketing strategies individually.

Performed some unique techniques to improve Accuracy Score for better model:

		1. K-Fold Cross Validation.
		2. objective = "reg:linear".
		3. Feature Importances.
		4. Scaler Transformtion
